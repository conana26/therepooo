# Wave To Earth Band Website

My project is a functional website that allows users to explore and learn more about the band Wave To Earth. Let me give you a quick walkthrough. On the index.html page (homepage), users would first notice the bands newest album,
play with earth! 0.03, as well as the featured song annie. Scrolling down, users would be briefly introduced to the merchandise and history of the band. On the music page, users are introduced to the three wave to earth 
albums. On the third album, users may click on it to view its songs. On the tour page, users are able to see the upcoming tour events and dates, with location and website links available to know more. On the merch page, users
may choose to purchase any merch that the website offers. On the AboutUs page, users are able to know more about the band, Wave To Earth. 

# Design Process

For my design process, I chose to incorporate a variety of animations and transitions to make the website more user friendly. As a user, I would definitely want to visit a website that is user friendly and have interesting
transitions and animations. I decided to allow users to hover over many different icons and texts, with those that triggers something when pressed to have their hover cursor as a pointer, and those with no effect when pressed
to keep their cursor default. For backgrounds, I chose to implement the zoominandout animation as well as gradients over an image. Having the animation makes the website seem more professional and having gradients allow the icons,
texts or slideshows overlaying the background to have a higher visual hierachy. 
The link below shows you my process in creating the website.

## Features

My proudest feature that I implemented would be the slideshow on the AboutUs page as there are many properties to it, such as it being automatic and having a translucent border around it. 
Another feature I added would be the background images and video having a gradient and the zoominandout animation that I learnt from YouTube.
I implemented the dropdown feature for both the Music2 page and the Merch page, which allows users to better navigate items through filtering.

 
### Existing Features
- Slideshow - Allows users to view popular images of the band to get to know them better 
- Dropdown-bar - Allows users to filter topics to navigate items better
- Transitions - Ensures a clean, smooth user interface for users 

### Features Left to Implement
-  A purchasing page for users to make payments for merch 

## Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project. Other platforms used would be W3Schools and YouTube, which were a great help for me when it came to implementing features. 
https://html.com/ Used for coding the wireframe
https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html Used for styling my code
https://www.javascript.com/ Used for features and transitions
https://www.w3schools.com/ Used to gain inspiration and knowledge of existing features

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

1. Learning about an Album:
   1. Go to the "Music" page
   2. Scroll down and find the album "0.1 flaws and all."
   3. click on view more
   4. Use the dropdown bar to filter by duration 
My project has been tested and modified to fit different browsers to fit to as small as a 460px screen by using media queries. Desktop and mobile views may appear visually different
to fit the overall frame of a device.

Some of the most interesting problems I faced during the testing phase would be the alignment of items. If items are not grouped correctly in div boxes, it would be very hard to align
them as desired. 
Another interesting problem I faced would be the making of the slideshow. I had to watch many YouTube videos on it and testing it out on my own code. Many of them failed to work as
they could not run automatically.
